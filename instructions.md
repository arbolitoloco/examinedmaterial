# Automated Examined Material List

Developed as a series of Google Apps Scripts, embedded in a Google Spreadsheet.

It pulls specimen data from a regular Excel or CSV file, filters it, then merges the summarized data in a formatted output, according to examined material guidelines.

Provided as is; it's not supposed to be used today, it's more of a documentation on how I used to make examined material lists up until 2016.

## General instructions

*Notice*: this referes to the original application, developed in 2013, in a previous Google Apps Script version. It hasn't been updated since, so it may contain errors.

### Set up the scripts

1. Create a Google Spreadsheet where the examined material data will be inserted (each species at a time);
2. Add all scripts provided here in the spreadsheet (Tools -> Script editor);
3. Authorize application as unverified (unsafe);
4. A menu called "Examined Material" should appear with instructions and function triggers.
